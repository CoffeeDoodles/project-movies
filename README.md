# Project Movies 
This week's project is to build a multi-page React app using a fun movieAPI to fetch a list of movies to display on the first page (with title, image, and release dates) and then be linked to a details page about the movie once clicked on.

## The problem
We started by breaking down the project into workable components and pages first. We started with the front page first and didn't encounter many issues thanks to our awesome teamwork. However on the details page we had some trouble with the background image properly covering the page but after discussing with our Turtle team during our demo, we decided to approach it from a more responsive styling (originally adding a inline style into the Details page). 

We also had an issue with our back-link covering the whole page instead of only the element button, it also wouldn't work for a while until we added a z-index to it. But after giving it a set height and width, we fixed the link issue.

We are overall very proud this project, and really enjoyed working together, learning more about how to work together (being very similar). It was the most fun we've had on a react project so far. :) 

If we had more time we would like to aim for the red and black requirements, and maybe add more css animations to the pages, because they're hella fun.
